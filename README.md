# Connect Four

The classic board game Connect Four programmed using jQuery, built as an assignment while I was a student at [SPICED Academy](https://spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/).

## Demo (click to try yourself)

## Built with

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery)

## Features

-   True to the original design, the blue board has six rows and seven columns
-   The board and header resize depending on the size of the user's screen (viewport)
-   Two players (black and red) take turns dropping their chips into columns by simply clicking
-   The first player to line up four consecutive chips vertically, horizontally, or vertically wins
-   As soon as a player wins, an animated banner slides in from the side, announcing victory and featuring a button to restart the game and play again

## Goals of Project

-   Handling extensive logic in a game environment
-   Initiating animations by conditionally adding CSS classes in JS
